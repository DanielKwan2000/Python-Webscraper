covid19 vaccines currently various stag development test one may eventually approve antivirus vaccine development traditionally require follow step preclinical test animals infect virus scientists study immune response see aspects immune response might critical protection normally vaccine first test animals however set pandemic one animal test stage skip phase 1 trials vaccine test small group people determine dose safely consistently stimulate immune system stage scientists yet know immune response trigger vaccine protect virus phase 2 trials vaccine give hundreds thousands people scientists continue focus whether vaccine safe produce consistent immune response phase 3 trials trials typically enroll tens thousands people first phase involve placebo group compare number people get sick vaccine group number people get sick placebo group phase show whether immune response trigger vaccine actually protect infection real world researchers combine trial phase effort speed covid19 vaccine development process addition us government create operation warp speed identify support mass production promise vaccines approve available quickly ultimately find safe effective likely
