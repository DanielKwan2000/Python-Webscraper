 hail “bigbudget nerdout” hbo’s hit series game throne go beyond pierce hearts many boy nerd demographic alone nonnerds watch people yes even women haven’t historically fantasy fall hard show that’s compel obvious hook swordfights sex nakedness intrigue – certainly indulge elements little escape reality show run deeper fantasy escapism hit us kinds level ask us get intimately acquaint character histories motivations simultaneously teach us idea what’s go resist kind delightful manipulation reason – help people analyze psychoanalyze pop culture live – show 1 it’s best “worldbuilding” one obvious value game throne it’s aim adults it’s know kid stuff barna donvovan phd professor film media study saint peter’s university say “game throne aim squarely adults campy selfreferential comical basically serious science fiction fantasy always do function symbolic commentary main social political issue day” word it’s definitely little ones even adult audience stay toe follow plotlines innuendos vein josué cardona therapist founder geektherapycom point game throne much nuanced predecessors “the show super complex” say “with many character storylines consider best worldbuilding ever do tv show engage show tv it’s cognitively engage dramas multiple thread none do extent fantasy genre got” game throne create world vicariously navigate every sense – topographic open credit lovehate relationships complicate always comprehendible character we’re emotionally invest happen next 2 it’s ridiculously smart brain choice stay engage world flat personalityless character tv mostly sitcom world dramas period piece fantasy emerge cerebral antidotes game throne arguably one smartest nuanced show around plot language smart fact hard follow reward since brain crave cerebral work show us critics like author article point show like game throne cater rise “mass intelligent” spawn whole new genre tv wry humor lyrical dialogues complicate moral question game throne make audience serious intellectual work – welcome activity days 3 organs get workout too… like shakespeare’s play game throne doesn’t explore ethical existential political dilemmas – enough lowbrow stuff keep everyone watch there’s sex violence jackinthebox moments gush internal organs act nice counter talkier part sexposition hallmark show supposedly force people pay attention essential plot explanation nakedness whether background sex really help us follow intricate monologues better totally clear 4 can’t bank what’s come allure somewhat frustrate element game throne think see thread show prove wrong central character kill psychopaths claim power weddings become bloodbaths bad guy develop consciences time pass twist turn plot lock us developments impossible anticipate give us dopamine rush keep us come back 5 character complexity make concept “good” “bad” moot complexity character show hail one major accomplishments may make likeable ways least “i think become emotionally invest character part they're human flawed” say forbes contributor erik kain who’s write lot show “ostensibly ‘good’ character often make horrific mistake eddard catelyn stark good intentions guilty absolutely awful politics course end badly many love ones less sympathetic character like hound still scrap goodness shin little moments heroism think real point save handful truly wicked peoplejoffrey baratheon ramsay boltoneven best character flaw even worst something redeeming” psychological complexity also make little unknowable fact characters’ action unpredictable force us give try decide who’s good guy who’s bad guy it’s almost suggest old question “good” “bad” isn’t even interest one anymore say phillip freeman md psychoanalyst psychiatrist film consultant “the book take time develop complexity characters” say “the television series however burden limit screen time many diverse stories tell seek add dimension character juxtapose heinous benevolent act rapid succession viewer subject moral whiplash fear much build sense character complexity even vicarious pleasure occasional moments unrestrained impulse build inadvertent case abandon moral distinctions per se” add series really isn’t good bad – it’s two interact inform one another “when enjoy series” say freeman “and frequently identification brutality sexual excitement rationalize might lord ring sense side right rather assure side progressive tolerance odd comfort keep company orgies massacres” maybe grey unknowable character accurate representations world today 6 archetypes present destroy rebuild connive queen ruthless king valiant knight ice zombies well last one maybe much show set number classic archetypes play extremely clever ways “the interest thing game thrones” say donovan “is way incorporate many archetypal character plot fantasy classic heroic mythic storytelling yet often alter even subvert them” say donovan “this kind experimentation archetypes make game throne truly superior piece art” example virginal blonde daenerys doesn’t stay sexually otherwise innocent long – shed oppressors namely brother husband get whirlwind education sex love death politics ethics end – it’s even end yet – she’s emerge different kind archetype alltogether promise female power may give central male character run money “daenerys seem emerge revolutionary idealist radical fight overthrow unjust systems free oppress yet one slowly succumb pressure compromise real world politics” say donovan “by end fourth season build small kingdom qualms ruthlessly meting punishment order rule challenged” epic journey isn’t complete she’s make way stag archetypedom swiftly number archetypes challenge narrative deserve discussion – tyrion one best “called ‘the imp’ ‘the half man’” say donovan “tyrion also supremely intelligent possess quick bite wit much embodiment trickster archetype see mythic storytelling throughout history around world like trickster often resemble fool upon first glance stories tyrion resent mock family save jaime root resentment tyrion know however intelligence despite startle physical appearance that’s embarrassment family smarter father siblings much like archetypal trickster tyrion use joke mockery expose others’ shortcomings hypocrisies pretensions lies” 7 women madonnas whore everything game thrones’ female character might even diverse male character interest since general less power like “period piece” female character formidable task navigate male world that’s never easy “the titular ‘game thrones’ mean play women” say donovan “in medieval society like women pawn tool advancement pleasure men therefore must learn use wits maneuver manipulate powerful men around them” true women introduce certain “types” – tomboy bitchy princess connive queen love mother witch warrior prostitute lot others – male character females morph various ways time maneuver male space women get exactly want perverse way arya antiprincess get vivid education live fight male male world – although journey probably somewhat different would like sansa get marry king want though abuse humiliation undergo part vision cersei hand powerful two yet victimlike since navigate even narrower straits “what make cersei lannister interest nuanced typical evil queen enchantresses mythology” say donovan “is fact see also female victim maledominated society world give options political tool arrange marriage assert gain measure power choice ruthless amoral world amorality reward power principled character break kill off” 8 storytelling politically correct even set “game throne offer special indulgence vicarious guiltfree barbarism” say freeman life every corner westeros completely unpolitically correct – good guy kill bad guy gain power women rap pawn people “differences” ridicule marginalize say there’s undercurrent sympathy run narrative “the story politically correct storytelling certainly is” say freeman “issues gender race differentlyabled multiculturalism handle sensitivity would make series welcome university survey course fantasy fiction” it’s obviously ugly world we’re peer there’s something deeply compassionate way it’s reveal 9 show use “medieval” fantasy point modernday reality lot great metaphors life today – battle kingdoms scheme politicos socioeconomic divide fragile economy game throne definitely offer commentary political dividedness “the ‘game thrones’ world much like one character ‘reach across aisle’ find common grind compromise” donovan point “the show perfect metaphor scorchedearth style politics deeply divide red stateblue state america westeros stand world fox news fan msnbc fan despise would accept nothing less complete annihilation side” arguably one best examples modernday metaphor show wall it’s design keep literal abstract it’s “effective metaphor unite states’ undocumented immigrant issue” say donovan “just like westeros us debate whether southern border seal larger ever restrictive wall foreigners attempt breach it” it’s also good analogy denial climate change well outside threat “as much oblivious white walker threat” say donovan “the kingdoms westeros also live denial fact major winter cover land… kingdoms preoccupy infighting preparation loom climate change parallel america’s attitudes environment climate change obvious” one could say wall represent american fear otherness well number ways say donovan show subtly ask “are slip semimedieval society own” 10 show doesn’t ignore difference celebrate yet show treat “difference” harshly tenderly doesn’t ignore “there character shape size show characteristics matter” say cardona “tyrion dwarf ignore contrast dinklage portray us senator latest xmen film size never address people treat specific way height people consider monster identity personality heavily influence it” hand he’s apparently “endowed” attribute physically mentally – he’s certainly quickestwitted insightful character show narrative seem offer basic commentary people always seem race may another example though it’s give much overt attention – yet anyway there’s clearly subtle subtle race stuff go “savage” dothrakis slightly darkskinned it’s clear matter one critic however felt dothraki depiction “positively cringeinducing…hbo nudge martin’s creation fully racial caricature cast seemingly random variety color people apparently raid productions ‘hair’ ‘braveheart’ clothe them” role race may also become obvious come season game come head “race could issue daenerys eventually make move westeros iron throne” say donovan “especially find kingdoms westeros might look dark skin natives east somehow inferior furthermore even daenerys’ appearance might foreshadow conflict subject might prove significant many dark skin people free oppression strikingly white savior pale skin blonde hair” broad look reason game throne draw wide fan base others please comment follow alicewalton find facebook
