A few months ago, Andrew Messick, the chief executive of Ironman, figured his company had diversified pretty well by organizing endurance races for fervent fans and participants all over the world.

On any given weekend, an Ironman-owned event was happening somewhere. The company’s sprawling operation included more than 235 races in over 50 countries. There are full (140.6 miles) and half (70.3 miles) Ironman triathlons, as well as marathons, cycling races and trail races.

Messick was pretty certain the geographic spread was a good thing, because while natural disasters or some other kind of calamity — fires, civil unrest, a war — might be happening in one region, surely there could not be a circumstance that would shut down live events in every part of the world.

Everyone knows what happened next. Ironman, which is largely dependent on live events, has postponed or canceled nearly all races through the end of June because of the coronavirus pandemic. The summer schedule is in flux, with some races still on the schedule and others canceled or postponed, but the company has little control over what happens next. Ironman Mont-Tremblant, scheduled for Aug. 23 in western Quebec, for example, will not happen as planned, because the Canadian province prohibited all sports and cultural events until September.
