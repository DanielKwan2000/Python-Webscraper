Synopsis

Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Game of Thrones is a TV series based on the book “A Song of Ice of Fire” by George R. R. Martin. It tells the story of the on-going battle between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros - as they fight for control of the coveted Iron Throne. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the far north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, led by House Stark's Jon Snow, is the first to encounter icy horrors that threaten all realms of men.



Initially centered a the tense (and lethal) rivalry between House Stark and House Lannister, the Game of Thrones story has expanded to include numerous other players who seek to rule Westeros - most notably Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of former ruler to the Iron Throne "The Mad King) and her dragons. The impending arrival of evil from the frozen wilds on the other side of the Northern wall, juxtaposed against Targaryen's fiery campaign to retake Westeros is widely regarded as the basis for the book series' canonical title: “A Song of Ice of Fire”.



The series premiered on HBO in the United states on April 17, 2011 - and quickly became one of the biggest event series in the "Golden Age" of TV. Winner of 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base. Game of Thrones has been one of the most popular shows on HBO for a long time and audience interest has shown no signs of slowing down. The hit show has already been renewed for Season 7, and will feature only seven episodes, down from the usual 10. It will, however, have a more concentrated focus, as key characters unite and turn toward King’s Landing, the capital city.
