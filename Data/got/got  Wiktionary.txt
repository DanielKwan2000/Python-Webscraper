Usage notes [ edit ]

( past participle of get ) : The second sentence literally means "At some time in the past I got (obtained) two children", but in "have got" constructions like this, where "got" is used in the sense of "obtained", the sense of obtaining is lost, becoming merely one of possessing, and the sentence is in effect just a more colloquial way of saying "I have two children". Similarly, the third sentence is just a more colloquial way of saying "How many children do you have?"

( past participle of get ) : The American and archaic British usage of the verb conjugates as get-got-gotten or as get-got-got depending on the meaning (see Usage Notes on "get" for details), whereas the modern British usage of the verb has mostly lost this distinction and conjugates as get-got-got in most cases.

( expressing obligation ) : "Got" is a filler word here with no obvious grammatical or semantic function. "I have to study for my exams" has the same meaning. It is often stressed in speech: "You've just got to see this."

( have ) : In nonstandard speech the verb may be reinterpreted as a regular present tense, so that the form gots appears in the third-person singular present, e.g. She gots a red bike.
