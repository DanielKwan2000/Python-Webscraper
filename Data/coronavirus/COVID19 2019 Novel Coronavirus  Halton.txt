Please note that municipality counts can be inflated by outbreaks occurring in institutions located in their boundaries, and comparing counts between municipalities does not take into account differences in their population size or age structure. There are currently no ongoing institutional outbreaks in Halton.

Among the total 25 Halton deaths, 12 (48%) have been residents or patients associated with a confirmed institutional outbreak. This includes 0 deaths from ongoing outbreaks, and 12 from resolved outbreaks. Data notes General: Extracted from CCM at 7 a.m. on July 22, 2020, with data current to end of day on July 21, 2020. All data are dynamic and subject to change with future updates. CCM is a dynamic disease reporting system which allows ongoing updates to data previously entered. As a result, data extracted from CCM represent a snapshot at the time of extraction and may differ from previous or subsequent reports. Tables are updated once per day on weekdays. The ‘change from last update’ reflects how much higher or lower the count is compared to the most recently published tables. The change does not reflect when cases’ symptoms began. As the tables are not updated on weekends, the ‘change from last update’ can be expected to be higher on Mondays and Tuesdays, as new cases reported on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are captured. Based on information gathered while doing case investigation, numbers may increase or decrease daily to reflect our most up to date information. Our main priority in outbreak management is prevention. Ensuring appropriate measures are being taken by the institutions requires time, in addition to collecting information on the status of the residents. For this reason, outbreak counts take time to be updated in CCM.

Probable cases are individuals presumed to have COVID-19 because they have symptoms of COVID-19 and are travelers returning from an affected area, have had close contact with a confirmed case, lived/worked in a facility experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, or had indeterminate test results.

All data includes only individuals whose main usual residence is in Halton Region. Currently active, recovered/resolved and deaths are a subset of total cases. Cases are considered to be active if the case is open in iPHIS. Cases are considered to be recovered/resolved if their symptoms have resolved, at least 14 days have passed since symptom onset, and/or the case has been closed in iPHIS.

Deaths include any death that occurred among a person who tested positive for COVID-19, even if the death may not have been directly attributable to COVID-19. Outbreaks: Date declared for outbreaks reflects the outbreak classification date in iPHIS or CCM.

Outbreaks may be listed with zero confirmed cases in residents/patients, because an outbreak can be declared if there is a confirmed case in one or more staff members. The number of cases among staff members has not been included because it can be difficult to track, since many staff members live outside Halton and are managed by the health unit where they reside.

The outbreak tables and the counts of residents or patients associated with a confirmed institutional outbreak refer only to confirmed outbreaks in long-term care homes, retirement homes, and hospitals.

Rates have been calculated using 2016 census estimates as the denominator. However, these rates should be viewed as estimates since many Halton neighbourhoods have experienced significant population growth since the 2016 census was conducted. This means that the number of COVID-19 cases in the numerator may be consistent with how many residents are actually living in the neighbourhood, but the denominators may be low since they have not changed since the 2016 census. This can result in rates per 10,000 that are overestimated.

Neighbourhoods in the map are based on neighbourhoods developed by Our Kids Network as part of a consultative process that took into account census, natural, municipal, and regional boundaries, while considering borders and names that would be meaningful to residents. For more information, please see the Neighbourhood Profiles page of the Our Kids Network website.

Rates per 10,000 were calculated because most neighbourhoods have between approximately 10,000 and 40,000 residents. This allows the rates to be accurately interpreted with respect to case counts. The area surrounding Bronte Park has no cases due to few individuals residing in that area.

Halton rates exclude cases among staff or residents of institutions or congregate care settings experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. The Ontario rate excludes cases among residents or staff of a long-term care home experiencing an outbreak.

These rates are crude rates, meaning they do not take into account demographic differences between neighbourhoods (for example, differences in age distribution).

The crude rates were calculated using the cumulative cases in each neighbourhood since the start of the pandemic. Including only active cases would result in low counts that may be identifying.

As case counts are low, most rates have wide associated confidence intervals, and so are not necessarily statistically significantly different from each other, nor from the overall Halton rate.

Cases of COVID-19 that could not be assigned to a neighbourhood (for example, due to inaccurate or missing address information) have been excluded from the maps and table (<5%).

Only includes cases with a diagnosing health unit of Halton (meaning the case primarily resides in Halton).

COVID-19 health advice

Most people with COVID-19 infection will develop mild symptoms and will recover on their own at home.

The risk of severe illness and outcomes is higher for older adults and those with weakened immune systems and underlying medical conditions (diabetes, heart and lung disease).
